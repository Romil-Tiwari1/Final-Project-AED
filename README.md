### A platform which takes care of all the aspects of Organ donation and their distribution

### Project Idea
The need of the organ donation platform is to connect a reciever and an organ donor. A donor can voluntarily register to donate
an organ on the platform. The Organ Bank takes care of the Organ Availability.ConsentVerification Organization takes care of the
consent for the transplantation. The patient and donor are connected and organ is transplanted successfully.
